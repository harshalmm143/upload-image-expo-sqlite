# Image Gallery App with SQLite Database Integration

This React Native application using expo allows users to pick images from their camera roll, 
store them locally using SQLite database integration, and view them in a gallery format. Users 
can upload images, delete them individually, and browse through their stored images effortlessly.

The app utilizes Expo for image handling, SQLite for local database management,
and React Native components for the user interface.
It provides a simple yet effective solution for managing images locally on mobile devices.
